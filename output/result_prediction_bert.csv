0,"road transport remains to be one of germany's main obstacles to effective greenhouse gas emissions reduction. even though the climate ambition is clear, disagreement about the preference of alternative low-carbon drive technologies for road transport persist to this day. while uncertainty is a main reason for this disagreement it has been largely ignored in the comparison of the three main options: battery electric vehicles, vehicles with hydrogen-based fuel cell, and vehicles with internal combustion engine based on decarbonized fuels. by combining argument mapping with uncertainty analysis we identify, characterize and compare the uncertainties on germany's energy transition of road transport. we find that all drive technologies are affected by a similar number and quality of uncertainties. our results emphasize why any final drive technology preference is still unjustified and why all options should be advanced alongside each other to avoid lock-in decisions. elsevier b.v.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5374811,0.5327939,0.5314196,0.58343667,0.56197524,0.52995044,0.50210243,0.48583952,0.62686205,0.49341202,0.549577,0.5644872,0.6016753,0.51318973

19,"this paper considers australia's climate and energy policies over the period and assesses the degree to which these two policy domains have co-evolved to define australia's low carbon energy trajectory. it finds that climate policy and energy policy have largely been dissociated from one another. this failure of policy coordination and integration has been caused in part by attempts to reconcile clashing and competing neoliberal and weak ecological modernization discourses, and is reflected in the diverging goals and paths of each policy domain. the inability of australian governments to define and articulate a coherent narrative around a low-carbon energy future has consequently constrained australia's sustainable energy transition and led to contradictory and disjointed outcomes. elsevier b.v.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6896295,0.43516558,0.43025514,0.5497497,0.55693346,0.45269346,0.3841863,0.47564432,0.658179,0.42212215,0.6744494,0.28919542,0.44886768,0.6271246
20,"fulfilling the un paris agreement on climate change requires societal change at transformational scales, with associated challenges that are intensified in developing countries. in this context, nationally appropriate mitigation actions (namas) a key instrument in support of developing countries climate actions are promoted for their high theoretical transformative potential. however, little is known of how namas are related to transformation in practice. this article studies how developing countries intend to use the instrument to implement climate actions and whether these intentions are related to how transformation can be spurred at landscape, regime, and niche levels. developing countries intended nationally determined contributions to the paris agreement are examined alongside representative nama proposals. although there is scope to improve consideration of the instrument's theoretically high transformative potential in actual design, current practices indicate that spurring transformational change is already a high priority of nama designers. elsevier b.v.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.4013718,0.6120836,0.545005,0.5850555,0.6065416,0.5296905,0.54134744,0.55935025,0.63426006,0.5764791,0.5122746,0.7398815,0.71373457,0.44615585
21,"while product service systems (pss) are not inherently sustainable, they may form part of the mix of innovations that contribute to the development of more sustainable futures. however, whether the current trajectory of pss research, with its emphasis on universal frameworks and standardisation adequately reflects and builds upon pss diversity revealed by case study research may be questioned. opportunities for transition to more sustainable pss may be lost. in response, this paper draws on sustainable architecture to propose fluid transitions to more sustainable pss: to pss design practices that embrace diversity and enable specific pss to be developed which address contextual interpretations of sustainability challenges. the core ideas of the pss design are critically engaged in light of the principles and priorities of fluid transitions. research directions to support fluid transitions to more sustainable pss design practices are then explicated. elsevier b.v.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41848361,0.5536701,0.51646197,0.5797823,0.5690977,0.5098859,0.5237983,0.5240553,0.6344634,0.55515486,0.5269035,0.7253645,0.64790785,0.47746417
22,"this paper proposes that niches, as protected spaces where technologies are developed and articulated with societal needs, transcend territorial boundaries, encompassing communities and actions that span several spatial levels. to support this assertion, the paper builds on the socio-cognitive perspective to niche development and extends it, introducing a new dimension - space - thus broadening and ""spatializing"" the concept of technological niche. this framework is applied to the case of wave energy. empirical research combines a generic analysis of the construction of an ""overall niche space"" with a detailed analysis of the processes taking place in portugal, which was one of the pioneers in the emerging field. the results confirm the niche multi-spatial dynamics, showing that it is shaped by the interplay between a niche relational space constructed by actors' actions and interactions, and the territorial effects introduced by their embeddedness in particular geographical and institutional settings. elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5853928,0.43522966,0.44389826,0.54768956,0.52791685,0.47625485,0.4543379,0.47000396,0.66235834,0.457239,0.6767304,0.44404164,0.48755386,0.61388004
23,"biofuels are the first feasible option for greenhouse gas emission reduction in aviation. this paper uses the lead markets framework to consider potential advantages in process plant required to produce nd generation biofuels for aviation. germany and brazil both have the potential to develop a lead market. they are active in technology development and have a demand interest through a significant aircraft and airline industry. the usa has also been found to be a country with a very high lead market potential. since the technology is at a demonstration stage, market information for the assessment of lead market advantages is not available. however, there are a range of indicators of firm activity and market potential that can be combined to make a general assessment. for this case, it is necessary for the lead market framework to be extended to consider international technology networks instead of a national lead market. elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.65851647,0.40682754,0.4221712,0.54223627,0.5615534,0.46616518,0.41026723,0.45504594,0.6524519,0.44230753,0.68600386,0.2962347,0.45940346,0.6135206
